This is a website for a nonprofit called Goal GetHers. Goal GetHers mission is to empower girls in sports by creating community and offering support to athletes and their familes.

I used a few new (to me) libraries to create this site including React Bootstrap and React Router.

Site is deployed here if you'd like to take a look: https://gallant-roentgen-38e9c8.netlify.app/
